# Web-Scraping-using-BeautifulSoup

The need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming increasingly loud and clear.
For some <b>Artificial Intelligence projects</b>, I find myself in a situation where I need to extract data from the web.

This repo contains some scripts to extract data from Tunisian Websites for News using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) in [Python](https://www.python.org/).


## Scraping rules :
* Check a website's Term and Conditions before scraping it and read the statements about legal use of the data. 
* Do not request data from the website too aggressiely and ensure that your program behaves in a reasonable manner.



## Usage

You can open the ipynb on Jupyter Notebook locally or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
