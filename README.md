# Web-Scraping-using-BeautifulSoup
This repository contains some scripts to extract data from Tunisian News' Websites using python and it's package Beautifulsoup.

The need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming increasingly loud and clear.
For some <b>Artificial Intelligence projects</b>, I find myself in a situation where I need to extract data from the web.



In this repo Web Scraping is done on an E-Commerce Website using BeautifulSoup in [Python](https://www.python.org/)

[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
* Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.



A collection of small programs that extract data from a website and packages it to be useful with the use of BeautifulSoup, a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. Once you retrive the raw HTML of a site, you can start to select and extract with BeautifulSoup, which parses raw HTML strings and produces an object that mirrors HTML documents' structure.

### The Rules of Scraping
1. Check a website's Term and Conditions before scraping it and read the statements about legal use of the data. 
2. Do not request data from the website too aggressiely and ensure that your program behaves in a reasonable manner.
3. Revisit the website and rewrite code as needed as the layout of the site may change.



### Usage

You can open the ipynb on Jupyter Notebook locally or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
